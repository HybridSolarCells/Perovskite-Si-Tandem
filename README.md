## Requirements

[Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) 

## Installation

Download the file fitting_procedure.nb and the [ASTM G173-03 Reference Spectra (ASTMG173.xls)](http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/spectra/am1.5/astmg173/astmg173.html) and include these files in the directory where you are performing the analysis. Open the file fitting_procedure.nb with Wolfram Mathematica and evaluate the notebook.
